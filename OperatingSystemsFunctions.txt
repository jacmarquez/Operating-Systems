Memory management is the function responsible for managing the computer's primary memory. For example RAM contains of one or more chips on a motherboard that holds 
items such as data and instructions while the processor interprets and executes them. The memory management function keeps track of the status of each memory location, 
either allocated or free for reuse when no longer needed. 

Another operating system function is a performance monitor, which is a program that asseses and reports the information about different computers
and devices. The information in performance reports helps users and administrators indentify a problem with resources so they can try and resolve issues.
it keeps track of software installs/uninstalls and all system, application, and hardware failures over the lifetime of the system.
