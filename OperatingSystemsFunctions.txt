Memory management is the function responsible for managing the computer's primary memory. For example RAM contains of one or more chips on a motherboard that holds 
items such as data and instructions while the processor interprets and executes them. The memory management function keeps track of the status of each memory location, 
either allocated or free for reuse when no longer needed.
